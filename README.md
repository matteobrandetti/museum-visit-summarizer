## Usage
### Launching the Web App
There are two ways to launch the Web App. You need to do the following two steps:
1. You can either (i) download the executable `.jar` file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c6hdJKcqEGeAgQrlpvVt5k_Wi1UKNT_e/view?usp=sharing)
**OR** (ii) generate it using [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) in the following way: navigate inside the `acme-museum` folder and type
the command `mvn package` to compile and create the exectuable file.
2. Navigate to the folder where the `acme-museum-1.0.0.jar` is located, open the terminal and type the command `java -jar acme-museum-1.0.0.jar`. Then, wait for the database initialization and connect your browser to `localhost:8080`.
